## üñºÔ∏è Usage

There are 2 ways to use this app: through the CLI tool or using Docker. Here are some points to consider to help you choose which solution is best for you:

1. **CLI tool**: if you just intent to use __reddit-dl__ to download the files, but have no intention to automatically convert them to better/smaller formats (WebP/WebM), then stick with the CLI tool.

    - You can also use the CLI tool to convert files, however you must make sure that you have all the dependencies properly installed in your computer.

2. **Docker**: if you want __reddit-dl__ to not only download the files, but also convert them to better formats, then Docker is probably a better option since it comes with all required dependencies installed.

### CLI Tool

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/vegidio/reddit-downloader/releases) of __reddit-dl__ that matches your computer architecture and operating system. Extract the .zip file somewhere and then run the command below in the terminal:

```
$ reddit-dl -s onlyfans -u atomicbrunette18 -d /Downloads/Reddit
```

Where:

- `-s` (mandatory): the service where the files were originally posted; `onlyfans` or `fansly`.
- `-u` (mandatory): the user that you want to download images from.
- `-d` (optional): the directory where you want the files to be saved; default is the current directory.

For the full list of parameters, type `reddit-dl --help` in the terminal.

### Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in your computer, then run the command below:

```
$ docker run --rm -t \
    -e REDDIT_SERVICE=onlyfans \
    -e REDDIT_USER=atomicbrunette18 \
    -v "/path/in/your/computer:/tmp/reddit" \
    vegidio/reddit-downloader
```

Where:

- `-e REDDIT_SERVICE`: (mandatory): where the files were originally posted; `onlyfans` or `fansly`.
- `-e REDDIT_USER`: (mandatory): the user that you want to download images from.

#### Volume

For those that are not familiar with Docker, the `-v` (volume) parameter defines where the media will be saved, and it's divided in two parts, separated by the colon sign `:`. You just need to worry about the first part, on the left side of the colon sign (**don't change anything on the right side**) and update it according to a path in your computer where you want the media to be downloaded.

For example, if you want to download the media in the directory `/Downloads/Reddit` then the volume parameter should look like this `-v "/Downloads/Reddit:/tmp/reddit"`.

## üí° Features

### Remove duplicates

This application will automatically delete all files that are identical.

### Convert images/videos

You can convert the media downloaded to better formats (WebP for images and WebM for videos); this will make the files smaller but preserving the same quality. To do that you should:

- **CLI tool:** add the parameters `--convert-images` and/or `--convert-videos`, depending on what you need. However, in order for the conversion to work, you must have the dependencies [libwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) and [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed in your computer.
  
  You can check if the dependencies are properly installed and ready to be used with **reddit-dl** by running the command `reddit-dl check-deps`.

- **Docker:** if you don't want to worry about installing dependencies, you can use **reddit-dl** with Docker and add the environment variables `-e REDDIT_CONVERT_IMAGES=true` and/or `-e REDDIT_CONVERT_VIDEOS=true` when you run the container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

In the project's root folder run in the CLI:

Go:
```
$ go build -o reddit-dl
```

Docker:
```
$ docker build -t vegidio/reddit-downloader .
```

## üìà Telemetry

This app collects information about the data that you're downloading to help me track bugs and improve the general stability of the software.

**No identifiable information about you or your computer is tracked.** But if you still want to stop the telemetry, you can do that by adding the flag `--no-telemetry` in the CLI tool or the environment variable `-e REDDIT_TELEMETRY=false` when you run the Docker container.
